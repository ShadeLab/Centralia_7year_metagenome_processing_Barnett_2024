### Abstract
We examined the dynamics of soil microbiomes under heat press disturbance from an underground coal mine fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania. Here we present metagenomic sequencing and assembly data from soil microbiomes across seven consecutive years at repeatedly sampled fire affected sites along with unaffected reference sites.
